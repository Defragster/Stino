# Stino2017

Stino is a [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com) plugin that provides an [Arduino](http://arduino.cc)-like environement for editing, compiling and uploading sketches. The plugin was written by @Robot-Will in 2012-2017. If you have any ideas or suggestions, please leave messages at [Issues](https://github.com/Robot-Will/Stino/issues). Thanks.

### Current State
Stino2017 is a totally new software and it is under developing, please be patient. Thanks a lot!

Currently it works for Arduino Avr Boards, and still a lot of works to do to complete and test this plugin. I am working on Windows 10 x64 currently, and maybe on other platforms it will encounter many errors. You can press ctrl+` to open SublimeText console and find the error messages. The error messages will help to improve this plugin.

### Requirements
[Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com) 3.0 (developing under Build 3126)
